<!-- # ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: 

  I would describe a parameter as a variable that we can define in the function declaration. Parameters act kind of like place holders for a function that will later give it value. 

  An argument is what passes value to parameters as mentioned earlier. When we pass value to a function we are usually calling it. I would say an argument is when you are trying to pass value or an expression to a function.

ex: function favortieDessertflavors: (cookie, cake){
  return chocolate, vanilla
}


  Researched answer:

A parameter is the variable notated inside the parenthsis that acts as a placeholder for what is expected to be called back in the function or given value. 

An argument is the value or expression that is sent back to the parameter to run through the function. 


2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer:

The .map() feature is a feature that creates a new array after going through each element in an array after a function has been called. The .map() feature uses the function command that was addressed to go through each element in the array one time and returns a new array with the new values that resulted. 


  Researched answer:

The .map() returns a new array with new values that resulted from going through an arrays indivual elements.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map() is a tool that is used to return pieces of an array individually. The .map() feature goes through each portion of an array and is commonly used in loops for iteration purposes. The .filter() returns a subset of an array of wanted elemnts by removing those we did not want. 

  Researched answer:

The .map() tool returns indivual elements of an array indivually and returns a new array. The .filter() feature returns a new array by removing those elements we did not want in the function byways of the argument.


4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer:

A function has a set of code that can be called directly by its name with or without paramter indentification.


A method is a function you use in an object or class and can be called using square bracket or . notation to call the object.

  Researched answer:

A fuction is a set of resuable code that code be used anywhere and it passes data and returns unique data. A method is a function that is specifically called by the name of the object associated. Although they are both the same one is speicific to an object which is a class instance. 


5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: I like object destructuring becuase it is almost like the unpacking of values from a object properties or arrays. It is almost easy becuase a clear return is usually given when breaking them down.

  Researched answer:

Object destructing is used to extract data variables from arrays or object properties. This feature allows you to extract multiple pieces of data at once and you can even build new functions out of those datas.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer:
I dont know exactly to be honest. But I am assuming it has to do with moving a variable and I Say this becuase hoisting means to move something up. This term sounds familiar but I can not remember.

  Researched answer:

This refers to the process of moving the function declaration, classes or variables to the top the scope of the code before executing it. This action makes it easier for you to not lose trach of the code and the code is always easy to access. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance:

When you reuse code from a parent class to create a new class using those defintions found from the parent class. Class inhertiance allows you to make new classes from exisitng classes. 

2. React:
Used for building user interfaces for single page applications. React is almost like a database for javascript used for building interfaces. 

3. React state:

the javascript data in react is managed by a data object called react state. The data stored in react state is updated by class methods and when they are updated it chanegs the view of the page in the browsers data. 


4. React lifecycle methods:

The three licycles inclue moutning, updating and unmounting. 

Mounting includes putting information in the DOM (we will dicsuss next), the updating part is updating information in to the DOM and the unmounting part is when information is removed from the DOM. 

 5. DOM: The DOM stands for the Document Object Model that holds the structure for a website's contents. The structure is comprosied of the data embedded in the website through HTML, CSS and other modeld documents that is binded with javascript. -->
